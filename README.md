# Genome-Methylation-Analysis
DNA methylation is a widely used biomarker to study development, disease, and even the molecular proceses of aging and mortality. In this analysis, we analyze the bisulfite sequencing methylation data of 34 patient samples. The first dataset is a gene methylation matrix containing 24,000 different sites on the genome. Each site is ranked from 0-1, based on thier methylation levels (1 indicates most methylation). The second dataset contains different patient characteristics. We generated an elastic net regression model based on Horvath's universal epigenetic clock used to predict epigenetic age. The repository also has exploratory data analysis code to predict additional health outcomes such as gender, weight, and BMI.
